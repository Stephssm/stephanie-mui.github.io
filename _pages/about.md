I am a Hale Visiting Assistant Professor at Georgia Tech, working with Galyna Livshyts. My current research interests are convex geometry, geometric analysis, and nonlinear partial differential equations (Monge-Ampere type). More specifically, I am working on Minkowski problems and geometric inequalities.

I earned my PhD in Mathematics from the Courant Institute of NYU, in May 2023. My advisors were Deane Yang and Gaoyong Zhang. Previously at GMU, I worked on constructing Nash-Kuiper 3D surfaces with my undergraduate mentor/ master's degree advisor Sean Lawton.
