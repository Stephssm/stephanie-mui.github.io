I am a PhD student at NYU Courant, studying under my advisors Deane Yang and Gaoyong Zhang.   I am currently researching in convex geometry, specifically working on Minkowski problems and geometric inequalities.  Previously at GMU, I worked on constructing Nash-Kuiper 3D surfaces with my undergraduate mentor Sean Lawton.
