I am a Hale Visiting Assistant Professor at Georgia Tech, working with Galyna Livshyts.I am currently researching in convex geometry, geometric analysis, and nonlinear partial differential equations (Monge-Ampere type), specifically working on Minkowski problems and geometric inequalities.
I earned my PhD in Mathematics from the Courant Institute of NYU, studying under my advisors Deane Yang and Gaoyong Zhang. Previously at GMU, I worked on constructing Nash-Kuiper 3D surfaces with my undergraduate mentor/ master's degree advisor Sean Lawton.
