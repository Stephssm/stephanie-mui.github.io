**S. Mui, On the Lp Aleksandrov Problem for negative p, Adv. Math, 408 (2022).** [link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870822003905)<br>
We prove the existence of a solution to the Lp Aleksandrov problem or the case of given even measures and p ∈ (−1, 0). Furthermore, a sufficient measure concentration condition was provided for the case of p ≤ −1, again provided that the given measure is even.

**S. Mui, On the L^{p} dual Minkowski problem for -1<p<0, in preparation.**,  
We prove the existence of a solution to the L^{p} dual Minkowski problem for the case of q<p+1, -1<p<0, and p \neq q for even measures.
